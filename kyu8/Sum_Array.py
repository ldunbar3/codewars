'''
Write a method sum (sum_array in python, sumarray in julia, SumArray in C#) that 
takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. These may be integers 
or decimals for Ruby and any instance of Num for Haskell. The numbers can also be 
negative. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

def sum_array(a):
    return sum(a)
